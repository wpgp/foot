# foot: An R package for processing building footprints

*[WorldPop Research Group, University of
Southampton](https://www.worldpop.org/)*

While remote sensing has long been used to monitor urbanisation
patterns, in recent years there has been an increasing availability in
finer resolution satellite data covering large areas of the globe. This
very high resolution imagery (often &lt;1 m spatial resolution),
combined with increased computing power is producing new datasets on
urban areas. In particular, machine learning algorithms are being
applied to detect, automatically extract, and map full sets of building
features in a scene. These automated methods add to the manually
digitised information such as from
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) and the property datasets
available from some city governments.

Such building footprint datasets provide a new level of detail on urban
areas, particularly in places which might otherwise lack detailed maps
on cities and rapidly growing areas. Despite their spatial detail,
building footprints typically lack any other attribute information to
help differentiate land uses or other neighbourhood characteristics.
However, the size, shape, orientation, and clustering of structures
produces a spatial pattern that can suggest areas of different land use
or activities.

The `foot` package is designed to provide a set of consistent and
flexible tools for processing 2D vector representations of buildings and
calculating urban morphology measurements. The functionality includes
basic geometry and morphology measures, distance and clustering metrics.
These calculations are supported with helper functions for spatial
intersections and tiled reading/writing of data.

## Installation

The `foot` package can be installed directly from Github.

``` r
devtools::install_github("wpgp/foot", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Note that building and running the code may require additional packages:
`stars`, `raster`, `sf`, `data.table`, `lwgeom`, `mmap`. et al.

## Quick Start

A sample dataset of building footprints is provided:

    # load the sample
    data("kampala", package="foot")

    # 2D vector building polygons
    kampala$buildings

### Vignettes

Vignettes are provided as an introduction to `foot`. The vignette on
basic usage is available from `vignette("footsteps", package = "foot")`.
The supplied datasets can be used to replicate this vignette. For a
discussion and example of creating gridded data layers, see
`vignette("bigfoot", package = "foot")`. Finally, techniques for using
custom morphology metric functions with `foot` is demonstrated in
`vignette("cobbler", package = "foot")`. These vignettes are also
available from this package website.

### Basic Usage

``` r
library(foot)

# load sample data
data("kampala", package = "foot")
buildings <- kampala$buildings
zones <- kampala$adminZones
grid <- kampala$mastergrid
```

The `foot` package provides tools to calculate and summarise building
morphology measures at multiple scales. These include building-level
geometry measures.

``` r
# building-level metrics
buildings$built_area <- calculate_footstats(buildings, what = "area")
#> Selecting metrics 
#> Setting control values. 
#> Pre-calculating areas 
#> No summary functions found, returning metrics.
  head(buildings)
#> Simple feature collection with 6 features and 2 fields
#> Geometry type: POLYGON
#> Dimension:     XY
#> Bounding box:  xmin: 32.60765 ymin: 0.341117 xmax: 32.61288 ymax: 0.345773
#> Geodetic CRS:  WGS 84
#>   FID_1                       geometry            area
#> 1   130 POLYGON ((32.61287 0.341117...  22.10707 [m^2]
#> 2   132 POLYGON ((32.6123 0.341771,... 221.37976 [m^2]
#> 3   133 POLYGON ((32.60812 0.34277,...  39.13247 [m^2]
#> 4   135 POLYGON ((32.60784 0.343618... 388.48091 [m^2]
#> 5   137 POLYGON ((32.608 0.344555, ... 351.14738 [m^2]
#> 6   138 POLYGON ((32.60772 0.345582... 164.74579 [m^2]
```

As well as area-level summaries within spatial zones.

``` r
# Area-level summary metrics
# Optionally, create an index for the buildings to zones
building_zone <- zonalIndex(buildings, 
                            zones, 
                            zoneField = "Id", 
                            returnObject = TRUE)

# summarise metrics within small areal units
admin_area <- calculate_footstats(building_zone, 
                                  zone = "Id", 
                                  what = "area", how = "mean")
#> Selecting metrics 
#> Setting control values. 
#> Pre-calculating areas 
#> Creating zonal index 
#> 
#> Calculating  1  metrics ... 
#>    area mean  
#> Finished calculating metrics.
  head(admin_area)
#>    Id       area_mean
#> 1:  1  404.4062 [m^2]
#> 2:  2  212.0011 [m^2]
#> 3:  3  527.4325 [m^2]
#> 4:  4  557.5857 [m^2]
#> 5:  5  571.2692 [m^2]
#> 6:  6 1026.5419 [m^2]
```

Or gridded summary outputs, with the options to include a circular focal
window.

``` r
# calculated along a raster within a circular focal window
gridded <- calculate_bigfoot(buildings, 
                             what = "area", 
                             how = "mean",
                             focalRadius = 200,
                             template = grid,
                             outputPath = tempdir())

  raster::plot(raster::raster(gridded))
  plot(sf::st_geometry(buildings), add = TRUE)
