\title{Rotated minimum bounding rectangle}
\usage{
fs_mbr(X, returnShape = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{polygons of building footprints in type \code{sf}.}

\item{returnShape}{logical. Should the function return the \code{sf} polygon
of the rotated bounding rectangle or should it return the angle (in degrees).}
}
\value{
a numeric angle from 0 to 360 degrees or the rotated rectangle as a
  polygon of type \code{sf}.
}
\description{
Helper function to provide the minimum rotated bounding
  rectangle of a polygon or set of points. Optionally, the function will
  return the bearing angle in degrees from vertical in a clockwise direction.
